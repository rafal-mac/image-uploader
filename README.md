## Overview

Working on this application was a great reminder of how pure javascript works and allowed me to play with webpack config for the first time. Developing without a framework like Vue or React was challenging but also very refreshing.

I learnt the basics of the Firebase ecosystem, especially Cloud Storage and Hosting. As well as the principles of bundling.

### Built With

The app was built with pure HTML, CSS + Javascript without any frameworks and bundled using bootstrap. For file uploads and storage I used Firebase Cloud Storage and for hosting and deployments - Firebase Hosting and GitHub Actions. I also used Bootstrap 5 to aid styling.
